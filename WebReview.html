    <h1>
        <p>This assignment has been very interesting and a fun way to grasp the basic concepts of both web and graphic
            design. I have coded previously throughout my A-levels. However, since I have taken a gap year over the last
            year, I have found I have become very, very rusty and having created this site it was a nice way to brush up
            on my skills. </p>

        <p> I would say that my most successful task was the typography task, although it may have come across
            straightforward, I initially struggled with the basics of using the tools within adobe illustrator, but once
            I had set up my artboards and watched a few tutorials, I was okay. </p>

        <p> The task I found the hardest was the poster project, the reason I say this is due to me having already been
            given the assets to be used, I felt it throttled my creativity and I found it particularly hard to think of
            unique and interesting ways to design my poster, next time I would like to not rush so much and panic with
            this as I feel that there is a lack of quality due to this.</p>

        <p>The coding worksheets were another thing that I enjoyed working on as mentioned earlier I was very rusty on
            my coding skills and having to work on the tasks I was able to pick it back up. I also had never heard of
            flexbox, so I enjoyed learning how to use that and how to make a site more fluid to use and problem-solving
            within the tasks.</p>

        <p>All in all, I’d generally say that my site is laid out well, I opted more for simplicity so that I wouldn’t
            run into too many errors, however I have found that my navigation bar disappears when using the internet in
            windowed mode. I wasn’t able to find a fix for this issue and if my site was for commercial use this would
            be a big problem. Another thing I would like to focus on next time would potentially having the use of p5.js
            within my site, as I have been learning this in another module and I would like to flex my muscles. I could
            also have added more to my index page as it is quite barren, however I was unsure what could be put there.
            The successes in my site alongside what has been previously mentioned is the use of my CSS to create well
            positioned items , images and ensuring that they scale to size without having the image stretch and also the
            use of implementing a font from the google sites.</p>

        <p>Although I personally believe I haven’t done as well as I think I can do, I think I have made a good start
            to the module and I’m ready to take on the next one.</p>
