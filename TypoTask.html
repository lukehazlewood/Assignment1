        <img src="bilateral.png" class="center">
        <h2><p><b><u>Bilateral</u></b></p></h2>
        <h1><p>Similar to an axial system, a bilateral system, however, centres all of its elements symmetrically on the axis. I focused on creating a fluid body of text that almost build a square shape. This was done by making the text boxes narrow and splitting longer bits of text up.</p></h1>
        </div>
    
         <div class = "gallery">
        <img src="axial.png" class="center">
        <h2><p><b><u>Axial</u></b></p></h2>
        <h1><p>In the axial system, all elements must be aligned to the left or right side of the central axis, I wanted to make mine more interesting by aligning my contents diagonally and adding some shapes as well.</p></h1>
        </div>
    
        <div class = "gallery">
        <img src="Transitional.png" class="center">
        <h2><p><b><u>Transitional</u></b></p></h2>
        <h1><p>For transitional the elements are layered in an informal manner, I decided to put my text within wavy lines through adobe illustrator</p></h1>
        </div>

        <div class = "gallery">
            <img src="Radial.png" class="center">
            <h2><p><b><u>Radial</u></b></p></h2>
            <h1><p>Within this system the text must extend from a central point of focus, I decided to make my text extend from an invisible circle, however I think next time I could focus more on the positioning of my text to really make it wrap around said “circle”</p></h1>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class = "divgallery">
        <div class = "gallery">
        <img src="Random.png" class="center">
         <h2><p><b><u>Random</u></b></p></h2>
        <h1><p>Random really has no rules, in this I wanted to have my text displayed in a chaotic manner whilst also ensuring that the title was still legible, it takes a longer time to read the text layered underneath however, so next time I would like to find techniques that would make this more possible</p></h1>
        </div>
    
         <div class = "gallery">
        <img src="modular.png" class="center">
        <h2><p><b><u>modular</u></b></p></h2>
        <h1><p>Modular layouts use repeating structures to break up the content, for this I opted toward putting my text inside circles whilst also having the main information positioned off centre at the top of the box.</p></h1>
        </div>
    
        <div class = "gallery">
        <img src="grid.png" class="center">
        <h2><p><b><u>Grid</u></b></p></h2>
        <h1><p>Grid is relatively simple to explain, all elements are aligned onto grids, for this I made two small square bodies of text and separated them by having two other grid elements, squares.</p></h1>
        </div>

        <div class = "gallery">
            <img src="dilatational.png" class="center">
            <h2><p><b><u>Dilatational</u></b></p></h2>
            <h1><p>Elements are displayed in a circular structure within the dilatational system, I had the circle displaying the name of the Arnolfini centre positioned on the outermost circle due to the importance, I also had it displayed in bold to make it more noticeable.</p></h1>
