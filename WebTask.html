                    <p>Listed above is the published site for my tasks 1,2&3. I found that i had near to no struggle
                        when creating these pages due to the depth of the website. It taught me the basics of github and
                        how to properly lay things out within my website. next time I would like to be more experimental
                        rather than just being "by the book" with my work. Such as looking at using more suitable and
                        professional colourschemes.</p>

                    <p>Displayed is my tasks 4 and 5, as you are able to see I had learned the basics of flexbox. there
                        was a certain point where I had realised I faced issues. It was adding styles to the audio file
                        to make it centred within the page, I had tried multiple times to rectify this however I was
                        unable to find a fix. Next time I would like to use fonts that arent so similar for my seperate
                        pages and potentially using a more unique colourscheme once again.</p>
