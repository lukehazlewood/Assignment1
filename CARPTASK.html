        <h1><p>In this image I attempted to use all the stock images I had been given to see what sort of poster I could come up with, I began by using a large picture of the hot air balloon’s as my background and changed the opacity slightly in order to make my text more readable. I also decided to position the text of the dates in the open space between the balloons and the sky. This is due to the eyes being drawn to this position and it needed to be filled. I then included some information across the bottom of the poster. The text that I initially had I had changed to be similar to the logo, this is due to the simplicity and I believe that the image displays the fun and enjoyment that could be had at the fiesta.
         I think that the open space in the middle could be filled however, as it is quite empty, this could be with more text or potentially the use of shapes as that empty space looks as if it should be filled.</p></h1>

         <div class = "posters">
        <img src="A3 poster redesign 2.png" class="center">
        <h1><p>Poster 2 I tried to further my idea by adding a blue border behind the image, the bright colours evoke a sense of fun and enjoyment however I focused on avoiding red as it can connote a sense of danger. Once again I changed the fonts of the text to helvetica to have consistency through the site.
    
            New time I would like to have used positioning more to fill spaces within the poster.
            </p></h1>

        <div class = "posters">
        <img src="a3 poster 3.png" class="center">
        <h1><p>In this concept I had used a drawn graphic from the application procreate to be used as my background for my poster, I consolidated the idea from the last poster, using a pastel green border to evoke a sense of nature and safety and having the hot air balloon’s appear watercolored. I was aiming to be simplistic through this poster only having the logo and the date displayed.
    
            Next Time I would like to add the location to the poster as that is all that needs to be known.</p></h1>
